# How to run
## Docker

If you prefer, it's also possible to bring up the dev stack using docker. You can run the following from the root of this repo:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

This will build and deploy the frontend, as well as automatically populate the DB with test data.

Updating docker-compose.dev.yaml to have `RUN_CREATE_DB=0` will skip the test data DB population.

If you run into build issues, you may need to tear down and rebuild the containers:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml build --no-cache
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

## Populate DB with fake data

Examining the docker-compose file, you will notice the env var `INSERT_FAKE_DATA`. Setting this to `true` will run the `fake/main.py` script on startup.

## Local Super User

Examining the docker-compose file, you will notice the env var `CREATE_SUPER_USER`. Setting this to `true` will create a super user with the following credentials:

* **Username**: `admin`
* **Email**: `admin@example.com`
* **Password**: `admin`

You can override the above using the following env vars:

```
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD
```

## Database Schema changes

When making a DB change to `models.py`, you must create and then deploy a new migration.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml run --rm server python manage.py makemigrations

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml run --rm server python manage.py migrate
```

You may neeed to define the specific module you want to migrate. e.g:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml run --rm server python manage.py makemigrations base

docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml run --rm server python manage.py migrate base
```

Before you merge a PR with DB changes, make sure that you combine your migrations into a single file by deleting the new migration files, and recreating them.
